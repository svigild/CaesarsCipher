# CaesarsCipher
Simple Caesar cipher decryptor.  More specifically, it is a ROT13 cipher, this means that the letters are moved by 13 positions, that is, A=N and B=O. If you want to change the ROT13 cipher to another Cesar cipher, simply change the array named 'cipher' to the alphabet corresponding to the desired cipher.
